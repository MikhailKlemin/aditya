Selected read-ings of women’s literary and cultural productions will also illustrate the history of gender coding from the period of Empfindsamkeit to the fin de siècle . In addition to examining cultural artifacts, such as novels, plays, screen scripts, paintings and advertisements, the course also offers an insight into the Women’s movement (both in Eastern and Western Germany). An introduction to main concepts of gender theory provides the basis to analyze the variety of gender identities and representations. The language of instruction is English, and no prior knowledge of the German language is required. Advanced‑level students — i.e. students placed at the 300 level or higher in German language courses — must do the readings and submit their work in German.",

        "description": "The congeries of experimental movements collectively identified as Modernism, flourishing from prior to World War I until World War II, renegotiated artistic conventions, revived neglected traditions, and turned attention to the primary materials of art (sound, colour, language). In painting emerged a tendency to abstraction, in music a tendency to atonality, and in literature to non-mimetic forms. Experiments abounded in disjunctive, elliptical, impressionistic, allusive, and mythopoeic styles. Avant-garde artists organized into numerous schools, including the Imagists, Surrealists, Dadaists, Constructivists, Futurists, and Vorticists. The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the “Jazz Age,” the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance. While the course focuses on the lively cross-fertilization of British and American writing, the international scope of Modernism is also emphasized, as well as its diversity (e.g. in ballet, cinema, music, and painting).",

Students discuss the narrative strategies used to explore various versions of Irish identity. ENGL 357 The Irish Literary Revival (3 credits) This course traces the origins and nature of the extraordinary literary renaissance that occurred in Ireland from the 1880s to the 1920s. It examines issues such as the rise of Irish cultural nationalism and the concomitant turn to Ireland’s past, both mythic and historic, as well as the continuing influence of the Catholic Church and the British state. Writers studied include W.B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, J.M. Synge, James Joyce, and Sean O’Casey. ENGL 358 Emigrants and Immigrants: Writing the Irish Diaspora (3 credits) This course examines various forms of literary expression — novels, stories, poems, and life-writing (memoirs, autobiographies, letters) — from Ireland and the Irish Diaspora that address the experience of emigration, settlement, and integration of Irish migrants in various countries around the world. Issues explored include concepts of diasporic and transnational identities; the negotiation of forms of self-understanding and self-transformation in the context of hybridity, fluidity, and multiplicity; and the roles of landscape, memory, and cultural production as determining factors in the competing hegemonies of homeland and diaspora. A selection of texts by writers from Ireland (Brian Friel, Joseph O’Connor, Eavan Boland), Canada (D’Arcy McGee, Brian Moore, Jane Urquhart), America (William Kennedy, Alice McDermott, Maeve Brennan), England (Patrick MacGill, Elizabeth Bowen, William Trevor) and Australia (Thomas Keneally, Vincent Buckley) is explored. A selection of letters, diaries, and personal reflections by Irish immigrants is also studied.",

The programs prepare students for work in the professional planning, public policy, community development, and real estate fields. The Urban Planning programs are differentiated from Urban Studies by further skills training in the translation of theory into professional practice. Programs Students are responsible for satisfying their particular degree requirements. The superscript indicates credit value. All course substitutions must be approved by an academic advisor. Students enrolled in the Major in Urban Studies, or other undergraduate programs in Arts and Science, seeking to transfer to the BA Specialization in Urban Planning normally request a transfer at the end of their first year, after completing a minimum of nine URBS credits.

Through a selection of readings and case studies, feminist thought is examined in two interrelated senses: the exercise of woman-centred inquiry, and feminism as a critique of existing knowledge frameworks. Students are introduced to fundamental feminist notions such as the distinction between the private and the public, the notion of experience, androcentrism, and the division between the family and the economy. The history of feminist thought is explored as well as its articulation since the 1970s and its contribution to Women’s Studies and to social theory in general. Also examined is the potential and power of different feminist theories to effect social change and transform the social world they analyze.",

At a deeper level, it is also intended to explain what mathematics is all about and why some easily stated assertions, such as Fermat’s last theorem, are so difficult to prove. Students who complete the course successfully should have enough understanding and knowledge of fundamental ideas and techniques of mathematics to appreciate its power, its beauty, and its relevance in so many different fields such as architecture, art, commerce, engineering, music, and all of the sciences.",

Students learn the difference between critical thinking and gullibility. Students also develop skills to identify errors and misrepresentations in information presented in the media and in viewpoints driven by agendas rather than evidence. The organization, functioning, and development of personality are discussed from the point of view of the major current theories. Evidence from empirical studies is introduced to illustrate various influences on personality. Socio-economic, cultural, and biological factors may also be considered. This course considers current personality and social psychology research as it relates to people’s everyday lives. The focus is on blending these two research areas. The study of personality concerns itself with the psychology of the individual, individual differences, and the role of individual-level factors in explaining behaviour. In contrast, social psychology focuses on how behaviour may be influenced by social and contextual factors. Topics may include the many ways of describing the self and others, persuasion, group processes, close relationships, aggression, and prosocial behaviour.",

In the modern West, Yoga has become popular as a secular form of exercise. However, as this course shows, the diverse Yoga traditions of India have also involved sophisticated analyses of the mind and systems of meditation. Intrinsic to no single religion, Yoga has had roles in most South Asian traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sufism or Islamic mysticism. The course surveys this rich history, and the various forms of meditative and physical discipline Yoga has entailed. RELI 344 Hindu Myth and Narrative: the Epics and Puranas (3 credits) This course approaches Hinduism through its narrative literature, especially the great epics (the Mahabharata and Ramayana ) and mythological texts ( Puranas — the “Ancient Books”). Through stories of gods, devotees, villains, and heroes, the course explores the development of significant themes in the Hindu tradition, from ethics and philosophy to asceticism and devotion. An important focus of the course is the enduring cultural significance of myth and the epics, as retold through the ages in a variety of languages, cultural contexts, and media, including classical and vernacular texts, the oral tradition, drama, dance, and cinema. RELI 346 Gandhi, Colonialism, and Beyond (3 credits) This course concerns Hindu traditions in the modern world, beginning with the period of colonial British rule in South Asia. Students examine the writings and historical contexts of influential Hindu reformers, intellectuals, and activists, including Ram Mohun Roy, Dayananda Sarasvati, Swamy Vivekananda, the Tagores, V.D. Savarkar, and especially Mahatma Gandhi. Issues of focus include the history of the modern idea of Hinduism, responses to European thought and institutions (including Christianity), Hindu understandings of modernity, social change and reform, religious nationalism, contemporary gurus and their transnational movements, and Hinduism in the diaspora.",
