We will carve out provisional and speculative spaces that allow us to speak otherwise about sensory and affective relations between states, objects, and subjects. We will experiment with forms of writing proximity and intimacy that underwrite our concern and other affective experience from our individual positionalities. We will find ways to express these experiences, speak of them, sound them, move through and around them, and to re-envision them. At the same time, we will not be concerned at all, abandoning what Eve Sedgewick has called “paranoid” forms of concern, in order to embrace the wondrous, and “reparative” (Sedgewick).

No prior course work in ethics is presumed. It is intended for M.Sc. and Ph.D. students who want to deepen their knowledge of ethical issues in both the profit and not-for-profit sectors. For students pursuing further theoretical or empirical work in the field the course provides a solid theoretical foundation. Ethical theories to be examined include Utilitarianism, Kantian Deontology, human rights and virtue ethics. Building on these frameworks, ethical issues will be explored in areas that can include privacy, discrimination and affirmative action, whistle-blowing, workplace health and safety, advertising, conflict of interest, executive compensation, bribery in international business, corporate social responsibility and corporate governance.
