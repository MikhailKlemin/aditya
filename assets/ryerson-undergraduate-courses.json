It can be to judge the accuracy of data, to accept or reject a product or to determine the price charged in everyday commerce. The judgment made can only be as sound as the measurement is reliable. The error in making a measurement limits its usefulness. This course will introduce basic concepts associated with measurement and the uncertainty in measurement, including the source of error in measurement. Examples taken from the physical, biological and medical sciences will illustrate how the limitations of measurements can alter people's perceptions and the impact this can have on issues such as government policies and medical treatments.

Some provide quantitative techniques while others relate to specific skills. The problems and issues of strategy management cover the whole spectrum of business. Weighing the pros and cons of strategy requires a total enterprise perspective and a talent for judging how all of the relevant facts add up. To keep the discussions down to earth, each week real companies will be examined. In addition, the course uses some experiential exercises which may include a simulation.

The most important factor was successful management of the water resources for agriculture, urban supply, and industry. Starting in the third millennium BCE, we use case studies from Mesopotamia, the Roman Empire, the Middle East, and Europe to explore the hydraulic technologies employed, and to assess past and present social, political, economic, and environmental implications of water management and mismanagement.",
