Topics will include: plant collecting, plant identification and preparation of herbarium voucher specimens, documenting plant diversity in relation with ecological factors, vegetation sampling, observations on reproductive biology, natural history, and uses of plants by aboriginal peoples. Day trips may be arranged to various natural habitats, the Arboretum in Guelph and the Royal Botanical Gardens. The course is typically offered during two weeks in August.

        "Description": "This course aims to provide students with a thorough introduction to Roman civilization. Following a brief historical overview, each week we will discuss a different topic relevant to the culture and society of ancient Rome. We will assess the current state of knowledge for these topics and ask how they can contribute to our overall understanding of Roman history and culture. In addition, we will explore the extent to which our knowledge of Roman civilization has been altered/affected by portrayals in popular media. \n\nExclusions:  CL102",

Topics will include: plant collecting, plant identification and preparation of herbarium voucher specimens, documenting plant diversity in relation with ecological factors, vegetation sampling, observations on reproductive biology, natural history, and uses of plants by aboriginal peoples. Day trips may be arranged to various natural habitats, the Arboretum in Guelph and the Royal Botanical Gardens. The course is typically offered during two weeks in August.

        "Description": "This course examines how new technologies are helping to shape heritage studies and archaeological research in the 21st century. A growing interest in 3-D reconstruction and animation, Geographic Information Systems, photogrammetry, digital photography using drones, and other methods has quickly pushed archaeology into the digital age. This has also led to the rise of distinct sub-fields, such as archaeogaming, the study of the archaeology in and of video games. By focusing on the use and applicability of these methods to heritage studies, students will gain insight into digital archaeology and the way in which these methods provide an improved platform for preserving and presenting archaeological research to the public.",

This has also led to the rise of distinct sub-fields, such as archaeogaming, the study of the archaeology in and of video games. By focusing on the use and applicability of these methods to heritage studies, students will gain insight into digital archaeology and the way in which these methods provide an improved platform for preserving and presenting archaeological research to the public.",

The relationship between structure and function is stressed.\n\nPrerequisites: One of BI236, BI256, HE210 or BI210; registration status year 3 or year 4.\nExclusions: BI238, BI239, BI396H.",

Major topics include regulation, homeostasis, growth and development, reproduction, and adaptation.\n\nPrerequisites: BI110.\nExclusions: BI100*, BI101*, BI102*, BI117, BI119.\nNotes: 3 lecture hours, 2 biweekly tutorial hours",

        "Description": "This seminar-based course exposes students to the principles and theory of integrative biology through the exploration of biological questions across physiology, development and evolution. These three areas are the most integrative of the sub-disciplines of biology. At a fundamental level all three relate genetic processes to inputs from the environment. The emergent properties of organisms are best understood as resulting from the combined effects of development and physiology within the lifetimes of individuals, and the action of evolutionary processes over generations. In this course, students will be exposed to different study designs and statistical analyses. They will be required to write and peer‐evaluate a grant proposal which will help students hone their writing skills. They will also be required to review critically journal articles.",
