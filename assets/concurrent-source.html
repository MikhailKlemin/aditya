<div class="collapse-title"><strong>Concentration Definition</strong></div>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>Concentrations provide pathways for teacher candidates to develop their professional interests. With choices across a wide spectrum of educational topics, the concentrations allow for in-depth, rigorous, and critical examination of a particular field of study. As a result, a candidate will be well-prepared to be a leader in the area and to work within a collaborative teaching team.</p>
<p>A concentration comprises two complementary courses: an Educational Studies (EDST) course and a Focus (FOCI) course. As well, the 3-week alternative practicum is an experience that is directly related to the area, and is approved by the FOCI instructor.</p>
<p>The EDST course will address the breadth of the area while also facilitating a deeper understanding of the relevant issues through discussions, readings, and assignments. Professional knowledge and skills in a specialized area will be developed. This course will have a more theoretical and conceptual orientation than the complementary FOCI course, and will also connect theory to practice through relevant literature, case studies, and implications for practice.</p>
<p>The FOCI course will operationalize the theoretical orientation of the EDST course through the practical application of theory, knowledge, and skills. This understanding will be enhanced through such avenues as discussions, activities, projects, field trips, and interactions with practitioners. It will connect teacher candidates directly to the field through an Alternative Practicum which will involve hands-on, immersive experiences. The FOCI instructor will play a critical role in supporting teacher candidates in identifying and securing appropriate alternative practicum placements.</p>
<p>In addition to the descriptions above, concentrations also share other common features.</p>
<ul><li>The concentration is open to PJ and IS teacher candidates. Division-exclusive concentrations are created when it can be argued that the two contexts are markedly different.</li>
<li>Alternative practicum experiences can occur locally, provincially, nationally, or internationally.</li>
<li>Alternative practicum placements have multiple appropriate locations.</li>
<li>If an alternative practicum occurs in a school setting, it must be in a specialized setting (e.g., resource room, international school, hospital school, unique programs)</li>

<h3>Aboriginal Teacher Education (PJ &amp; IS)</h3>
<p><strong>EDST 201/3.0 Theory of Aboriginal Education</strong></p>
<p>This course provides a background into the history and theory of Aboriginal Education. It will commence with a discussion of Aboriginal identities and approaches to education from the pre-contact era into the present, as well as Western approaches to education through the lens of Critical Race Theory. The course will then move to Aboriginal educational theory, including such topics as Aboriginal concepts of the person and the learner; teaching as ceremony; Aboriginal differentiated instruction; holistic learning; global Aboriginal identities; language and education; and education for decolonization.</p>
<p><strong>FOCI 201/3.0 Aboriginal Teacher Education</strong></p>
<p>Prepares Aboriginal Teacher Education candidates to include Aboriginal curriculum as part of their classroom teaching. Explores Aboriginal community based curriculum development; a review of current Aboriginal curriculum packages and other resources; curriculum planning and evaluation. An experiential learning approach with aspects of the course applied during the candidates&#39; practice teaching rounds. Practicum experiences are explored during class sessions with such reflections providing the basis for further learning in the areas of curriculum planning and evaluation.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Arts in Education (PJ &amp; IS)</h3>
<p><strong>EDST 215/3.0 Museum Education</strong></p>
<p>Introduction to the principles and practices of museum education. In cooperation with our partner institution, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, teacher candidates will explore guided viewing strategies for art, historical artifacts, and natural specimens. Design of studio/lab-based application activities, and curriculum planning relevant to a variety of institutional settings are emphasized.</p>
<p><strong>FOCI 215/3.0 Arts in Education K to 12 </strong></p>
<p>This course is designed to present a view of schools where artifacts, art activities and art environments form the focus for learning across all academic subjects. Topics include arts and cognition; how arts programs can induce change in schools; the role of social learning and community knowledge; and arts-centred curriculum planning.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Assessment and Evaluation (PJ &amp; IS)</h3>
<p><strong>EDST 210/3.0 Understanding Classroom Assessment and Evaluation </strong></p>
<p>With the current accountability framework of K-12 education, teachers are required to use assessments to monitor and inform student learning, guide their instruction, and communicate student achievement. This course explores the complexities of enacting assessment policies and theories within contemporary teaching contexts. Varying philosophies and approaches to classroom assessment are explored with consideration for their pedagogical value. In addition, systemic assessment structures are examined to understand the impact and function of regional and provincial evaluation systems on teaching, learning, and policy decision-making. This course will provide teacher candidates with theoretical and philosophical positions from which to enact sound – reliable, valid, and fair – assessment practices.</p>
<p><strong>FOCI 210/3.0 Assessment and Evaluation Practices in the Classroom </strong></p>
<p>Assessment is a central component of teaching and learning within elementary and secondary classrooms. Current mandates require teachers to integrate assessment throughout their instruction to support, monitor, and communicate student learning. In this course, teacher candidates will learn how to develop and use assessment to promote student learning within a positive classroom culture. Specifically, candidates will learn about Ministry policies, rubrics, feedback mechanisms, observations, portfolios, testing (i.e., teacher-made and EQAO) as well as peer-, self-, and collaborative-assessment. Throughout the course, candidates will link assessment practices to learning theories and to their evolving pedagogical approach. By the end of the course, candidates should be able to engage in professional discussions and decision-making related to assessment and student learning. This course will fundamentally strengthen the candidates’ approach to teaching by connecting together educational and assessment theory, philosophy, and practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>At-Risk Adolescents and Young Adults (IS)</h3>
<p><strong>EDST 291/3.0 Understanding At-Risk Adolescents and Young Adults </strong></p>

The impact of socioeconomic status, family dynamics, social factors, and biological markers will be examined.</p>
<p><strong>FOCI 291/3.0 Teaching At-risk Adolescents and Young Adults</strong></p>
<p>Teacher candidates will develop efficacy in applying the theoretical principles taught in EDST 291 to increase their students’ success academically, behaviourally, and socially. A wide range of situations that place students at risk including mental health issues, substance use and addictions, LGBT issues, and family dynamics will be explored, along with evidence-based strategies proven to facilitate self-control, motivation, and improved classroom management. Learning will occur through a variety of readings matched with guest presentations from professionals and those with lived experience.</p>
