Legal aspects (e.g., incorporation, partnerships), raising capital, and protecting the strategic advantage of intellectual property (e.g., patents, trade secrets) are discussed, together with the importance of having a social license to operate. The concept of a business model, summarized using the business model canvas methodology, is presented, together with the concept of a business plan describing how a venture will be operated over a time horizon. For-profit and not-for-profit ventures, and the elements of the business models for each, are studied and compared. Financial metrics for assessing the viability of ventures and guiding investment decisions are presented (e.g., IRR, NPV, EBITDA). Systems Thinking (recognizing the whole/parts and that which is common/distinct) is introduced. Design Thinking – a human-centered design emphasizing observation and experimentation gaining traction in engineering, business and social sciences – is presented.

Curiosity of the world around us is emphasized for identifying opportunities to have an impact and make a difference, to which a discipline is imposed - one that identifies who might be interested in or benefit from our product or service, and how we can bring an idea to fruition and bring the necessary resources (e.g., financial, intellectual) to provide it to society. Legal aspects (e.g., incorporation, partnerships), raising capital, and protecting the strategic advantage of intellectual property (e.g., patents, trade secrets) are discussed, together with the importance of having a social acceptance to operate. The concept of a business model, summarized using the business model canvas methodology, is presented, together with the concept of a business plan describing how a venture will be operated over a time horizon. For-profit and not-for-profit ventures, and the elements of the business models for each, are studied and compared, and intrapreneurship/entrepreneurship are compared. Financial metrics for assessing the viability of ventures and guiding investment decisions are reviewed. Systems Thinking (recognizing the whole/parts and that which is common/distinct) is introduced. Design Thinking – a human-centered design emphasizing observation and insight - is presented, along with journey maps and personas for understanding customer segments. Diffusion of innovations is described, including the factors influencing adoption of innovations, and the manner in which innovations propagate in society. Working in groups, students identify a venture opportunity having a technological component, and propose a business model and plan as the major evaluation in the course. The transport phenomena approach is followed to study and analyze transport of momentum, energy and mass, with special focus on combined transport problems. Solutions are developed for problems involving steady-state and unsteady flows, isothermal and non-isothermal conditions, as well as non-Newtonian liquids.

Capabilities now exist to synthesize materials with grains where one or more dimension is on the nanoscale (less than 100 nm). As the grain size decreases, there is a significant increase in the volume fraction of grain boundaries or interfaces. This characteristic strongly influences the chemical and physical properties of the materials. For example, nanostructured ceramics are tougher and stronger than coarser grained ceramics, while nanostructured metals exhibit increases in yield strength and elastic modulus. It has also been shown that other properties (e.g. electrical, optical and magnetic) are influenced by a fine grain structure. The goal of this course is to introduce the student to the impact of length scale, from millimeter to nanometer, on material properties, with a primary but not exclusive focus on mechanical properties.
